            submit issuses here

          a(href='https://github.com/jiyinyiyong/she') She 
          span is a cli tool for generating part of brackets in Scheme.
        p
          span Use
          code npm install -g she
          span to install
          code she
          span from 
          a(href='https://npmjs.org/') NPM.
        p
          span Yeah.. You need to install nodejs first, 
          span rather than 
          a(href='http://chickadee.call-cc.org/') Chicken Scheme 
          span , which looks better.
        p
          span Run
          code she a.she
          span or
          code she a.ss
          span , and the process begins to watch and convert, 
          span just like the demo above.
        p
          span Use
          code she -q a.she
          span or
          code she --quick
          span to force it quit after running for one time.
        p
          span Option
          code -o
          span can be used to specify the output directory
          code she -o dir/ a.she
          span ,
        p
          span Or
          code she a.she -o dir/
          span as well. Only the first argument after
          code -o
          span works as directory.

        p.sub-title
          span How does she work on brackets..

        p
          span There a some rules.. Quite complicated to explain 
          span for me to use English on this issue.
        p
          span But indetations relates to brackets right? 
          span I wrote CoffeeScript to count the indetations first,
        p
          span then I try to add brackets according to the numbers.
          span For special characters, I have to handle them elsewhere.
        p
          span If you are interested about that, please read 
          a(href='https://github.com/jiyinyiyong/she') my code on Github 
          span which was writtern in CoffeeScript.
        p
          span That's all about she. I'm trying to learn Chicken these days.
